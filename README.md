  Looking at the above stats for June and December, it can conclude that the temperature is quite stable over at Oahu all year long and will be quite ideal to setup shop when looking strictly at the temperature. This however, does not include a detailed look into the precipitation levels, which is highly recommended as this will surely affect business. On the lowest temperature reading day in December, albeit a bit chilly, business can still operate provided that it isn't also raining on top of it. Another good analytic dive would be on the rest of the weather conditions that might be common for the rest of the year, knowing that the temperature is stable might not always help if weather is also constantly cloudy during peak seasons on the beach.
